%TODO: a little explanation for each world important elements
\subsection{Resulting worlds}
\paragraph{The world mainly from the CPO point of view}
From the CPO point of view we show the following world generated with the Alloy analyzer, noticing some important requirements of the eMall:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The CPO manages one or more charging stations
    \item The charging stations have one ore more charging points
    \item The charging points can have different socket types (in the following representation Alloy generated a case in which each charging point has only a socket of one type, but in general the charging point can have many sockets of different types, but we assume that only one is used at the time)
    %TODO: add assumption only a socket is used at the time
    \item The charging stations acquire energy from different DSOs chosen by the CPO, and different charging stations, even of different CPOs, can acquire energy from the same DSO 
\end{itemize}
We can see a simple representation of these elements in the CPOworld:

%TODO: retake this picture because has RegEVD instead of EVD and see if there are better representations, more focused on the EVD, we have no bookings here, and explain the requirements
\paragraph{The world mainly from the EVD point of view}
To represent the EVD point of view we show another world generated by the Alloy analyzer, in order to verify some requirements:
