\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}%
Widespread electrification of transport is the most efficient way to reach Europeâ€™s climate objectives for the sector and electric charging is the main asset to overcome the obstacles of the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs can reduce CO2 by an estimated annual 600,000 tons by 2030, going towards a carbon neutral Europe, and the importance of this aim raises the problem of having efficient systems that manage the charging services. The eMall is thought as an all-encompassing application that oversees the entire process from the user interaction to the effective recharge of the EV's battery.

The main goal we want to achieve with the eMall software is to help The EVDs (electric vehicle drivers) to have better access to recharge and to be able to book a charging point in order to avoid interference with his daily plans. Another important purpose of the system is to safeguard not only the users but also the providers of the service and this is made through privacy agreements and the actual interaction, that guarantees to supervise both interested parts, in order to get the best possible service and pay for it accordingly, having also a technical and economic exploitation of the charging infrastructures.

In this context there is an increase in the requested electric energy, but large amounts of power in short periods would require investments in the reinforcement of the distribution networks, which have not been designed to accommodate such load. It becomes necessary to introduce new systems and solutions to optimize the operation of the distribution networks. In this context we can identify the DSOs as the suppliers of electricity through the distribution networks. The DSOs interact with the eMall, and in particular with the CPMS (Charging Point Management System) module of the system to be. The CPMS, then, gives the information about the DSO's supply to the CPOs, which are important actors, that use the system in order to manage the charging service. A CPO is represented by an employee or a software, part of the business that owns some charging stations and wants to manage them through the eMall, deciding from where to acquire energy, and how to establish the prices, the special offers and other details about the stations.

The eMall is thought as a software that manages both the interaction with the businesses that offer the charging service and the interaction with the EVDs which want to use these services in order to charge their EVs. Therefore, the eMall provides a mobile application (eMma), which through its interface allows to the EVD to obtain the service, and provides, also, a web application that the CPOs use to manage the charging stations. The EVD interacts, as well, with the charging point interface (eMci), that communicates with the CPMS part of the eMall, in order to start the charging session from the station, plugging then the car to the compatible connector to effectively charge the EV.

\paragraph{Goals} In the following table we present the main goals of the software to be. The goals capture the needs of the stakeholders, which are the EVDs and the CPOs.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:Scope}%
\paragraph{World phenomena} The portion of the real world where the machine is to be deployed and used is called the environment. Hence, scoping the problem by defining the environment is paramount, and this is the target of the next table. With the world phenomena we define the environment in which the software to be will operate, by clarifying some facts about the world and the users. In the following chapter, to the environment will be also given some boundaries, making some assumptions and describing some domains properties, but this is not an aspect tackled by the next table of phenomena.

\paragraph{Shared phenomena} The shared phenomena define the interface through which the machine interacts with the world. The software monitors some shared phenomena, while controls others, and to show when the software takes the part of the controller and when the part of the observer we created two more columns in the next table, to keep track of the initiator of the action, in case the natural language turns out to be ambiguous. So, in the following assertions we present an interaction between the world (users and external systems) and the machine (the eMall, especially its interfaces, such as the eMma, the eMci and the managerial web application).
