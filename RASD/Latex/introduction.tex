\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}%
Widespread electrification of transport is the most efficient way to reach Europe’s climate objectives for the sector and electric charging is the main asset to overcome the obstacles of the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs can reduce CO2 by an estimated annual 600,000 tons by 2030, going towards a carbon neutral Europe and the importance of this aim raises the problem of having efficient systems that manage the charging services. The e-Mall is thought as an all-encompassing application that oversees the entire process from the user interaction to the effective recharge of the EV's battery.\\

The main goal we want to achieve with the e-Mall software is to help The EVDs (electric vehicle drivers) to have a better access to recharge and to be able to book a charging point in order to avoid interference with his daily plans. Another important purpose of the system is to safeguard not only the users but also the providers of the service and this is made thought privacy agreements and the actual interaction that guarantees to supervise the both interested parts, in order to get the best possible service and pay for it accordingly, having also a technical and economic exploitation of the charging infrastructures. \\

In this context there is an increase in the requested electric energy, but large amounts of power in short periods would require investments in the reinforcement of the distribution networks, which have not been designed to accommodate such load. It becomes necessary to introduce new systems and solutions to optimize the operation of distribution networks and we can identify the DSOs as important actors that have to monitor the networks in order to have a safe and controlled supply of the energy and manage faults in the assets. The DSOs communicate with the e-Mall, and in particular with the CPMS modules that decide from where to acquire energy in order to satisfy as well as possible the CPOs economical interests.

%TODO: specify how the user interacts with the eMall throught the mobile app, to make more clear the following notification part

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DSO}: typically the entity responsible for the operation and management of distribution networks – High, Medium and Low Voltage networks. For this purpose, the DSO typically owns systems such as Supervisory and Control Data Acquisition (SCADA)/ Distribution Management System (DMS) for the monitoring and general overview of the state of the network. It also owns other systems such as the Outage Management System (OMS) and Work Force Management System (WFMS) for addressing the network operation problems related with the continuity and quality of service.
    \item \textbf{CPO}: entity that technically manages all the EV infrastructure assets, depending of existing country regulation – this role can be assured by the DSO or other entity.
    \item \textbf{eMSP}: is the entity that can explore the economic side of the EV charging infrastructure, namely by selling energy for charging purposes.
    \item \textbf{CPMS}: is a software system that manages the charge point infrastructure – can manage the technical and economic aspects of the charging infrastructures.
    \item  \textbf{EV Driver}: person or entity who owns an EV car and can use the public or private facilities for charging purposes.

    \item \textbf{Socket outlet}: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle
    \item \textbf{Plug}: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE.
