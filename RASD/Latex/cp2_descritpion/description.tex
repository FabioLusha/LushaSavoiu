In this chapter a general overview of our software to be and its functionalities is given. In section \ref{sec:product_perspective} we will present a conceptual model of the domain we are working in, where, in addition to the real world objects that are significant in our domain and to our system, we include the main components of our system that will interface with the environment. Then, we proceed by presenting the state diagrams of the most important scenarios discussed in the following subsection. In section \ref{sec:Product functions} we give a description of the main functionalities our system has to provide, but without going in much detail since we will delve into this aspects in the next chapter. In section \ref{sec:User_characteristics} we provide an analysis of the target users of the system, which are the clients that will use the system or will interact with it. Finally, in section \ref{sec:Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}, we outline the assumptions, the dependencies and the constraints, necessary to be taken into account when implementing the software.
