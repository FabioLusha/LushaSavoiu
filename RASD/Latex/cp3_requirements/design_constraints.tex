In the section we specify constraints on the system design imposed by external standards, regulatory requirements, or project
limitations.

\subsection{Standard compliance}
The eMall system has to store all different kind of personal data provided by the users, therefore this data must be handled in accordance to the privacy regulation of the countries in which the organization will operate.

\subsection{Hardware limitations}
eMci is a subpart of the system that will run on an embedded system, so the limited computing resources of this kind of devices must be kept in mind in the design the architecture of the system. Furthermore, the screen component on this devices tend to be of small size and resolution, meaning that the GUI for this component must be simple. The same can be said for the eMma, which will run on mobile devices (smartphones or tablets) and an adequate user experience shall be granted to all users, even those with low-end devices. For the part of the eMSP that will handle the transactions coming form eMma and eMci and for the CPMS part of the system no particular hardware constraints are to be considered since they'll run as server process in a general purpose computer.

\subsection{Any other constraints}
No any other specific constraint is required.
