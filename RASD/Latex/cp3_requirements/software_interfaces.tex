\textit{Maybe should be put on the communication interface}\\
The CPMS subpart of the system that manages the charging station must communicate with the embedded software running both on the charging point device and on the battery management system of the batteries, if present. This means that the CPMS must be build with the possibility to inter operate with multiple kind of this system. In particular the system:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item The system shall support interoperability with a range of third-party software components
    \item The system shall be able to handle changes or updates to the third-party components, without affecting the overall functionality of the system
    \item The system shall be able to operate with a minimum of three different third-party components, and shall be scalable to support additional components as needed
\end{itemize}

The eMma must be able to interact with the other part of the eMsp.
