The main component of our system to be: eMma, eMci, eMsp and CPMS all have differente hardware needs; 
eMma shall be a mobile application, so:
\begin{itemize}
    % this is a software interface
    \item The system must be able to run on a range of mobile platforms, including Android and iOS, and must be compatible with the latest versions of these platforms
    \item The system must be able to adapt to the smaller screen sizes and limited processing power of mobile devices, while still providing a user-friendly and intuitive interface
    %Should go to the communication Interfaces
    \item The system must be able to securely transmit and store data on mobile devices, in compliance with relevant security standards and regulations
    \item The system must able to run adequately on low-end mobile devices with limited computational resources 
\end{itemize}
