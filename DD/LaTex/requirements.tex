In this chapter we create a mapping between the components defined before and the requirements defined in the RASD, in order to clarify the utility of the components to achieve the desired functionalities of the system to be. 
\section{Requirements}
For the DD to be self-contained we report here the table with the requirements defined in the RASD.
