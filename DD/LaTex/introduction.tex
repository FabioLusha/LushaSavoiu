\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}%
Widespread electrification of transport is the most efficient way to reach Europe’s climate objectives for the sector and electric charging is the main asset to overcome the obstacles of the take-up of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs can reduce CO2 by an estimated annual 600,000 tons by 2030, going towards a carbon neutral Europe, and the importance of this aim raises the problem of having efficient systems that manage the charging services. The eMall is thought as an all-encompassing application that oversees the entire process from the user interaction to the effective recharge of the EV's battery.

The main goal we want to achieve with the eMall software is to help the EVDs (electric vehicle drivers) to have better access to recharge and to be able to book a charging point in order to avoid interference with his daily plans. Another important purpose of the system is to safeguard not only the users but also the providers of the service and this is made through privacy agreements and the actual interaction, that guarantees to supervise both interested parts, in order to get the best possible service and pay for it accordingly, having also a technical and economic exploitation of the charging infrastructures.

In this context there is an increase in the requested electric energy, but large amounts of power in short periods would require investments in the reinforcement of the distribution networks, which have not been designed to accommodate such load. It becomes necessary to introduce new systems and solutions to optimize the operation of the distribution networks. In this context we can identify the DSOs as the suppliers of electricity through the distribution networks. The DSOs interact with the eMall, and in particular with the CPMS (Charging Point Management System) module of the system to be. The CPMS, then, gives the information about the DSO's supply to the CPOs, which are important actors, that use the system in order to manage the charging service. A CPO is represented by an employee or a software, part of the business that owns some charging stations and wants to manage them through the eMall, deciding from where to acquire energy, and how to establish the prices, the special offers and other details about the stations.

The eMall is thought as a software that manages both the interaction with the businesses that offer the charging service and the interaction with the EVDs which want to use these services in order to charge their EVs. Therefore, the eMall provides a mobile application (eMma), which through its interface allows to the EVD to obtain the service, and provides, also, a web application that the CPOs use to manage the charging stations. The EVD interacts, as well, with the charging point interface (eMci), that communicates with the CPMS part of the eMall, in order to start the charging session from the station, plugging then the car to the compatible connector to effectively charge the EV.\\

By the official definition of the IEEE Std 1016™-2009 standard, the DD is a representation of a software design that is to be used for recording design information, addressing various design concerns, and communicating that information to the design’s stakeholders. So, in this document we focus on the design of the system to be, describing the components and the interaction among them and with external systems, trough interfaces, in order to achieve the goals and satisfy the requirements explained in the RASD document. 

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:Scope}%
The eMall has two main stakeholders: the CPOs and the EVDs. There are different goals to satisfy respectively for the CPOs and the EVDs and different associated requirements to develop. For a detailed description of the domain in which the e-Mall will operate, and to see all the goals and the requirements, the reader should refer to the RASD. While, in this document, we briefly present the main design concerns of the stakeholders, and the main architectural styles. \\

The stakeholders have goals that, in order to be satisfied, need the storage of a large volume of data, therefore scalable technologies are required to manage the amount of information used by the system.
Also, the stakeholders, especially the EVDs, are not expert users, thus in order to have an user-friendly system is necessary to create a graphical interface with which the users will interact. The system will have a GUI for the eMma and a GUI for the web application used by the CPOs, compatible with any browser, in order to facilitate the access to the system. We want also for the user interfaces to be compliant with different devices, regardless of the screen size.\\

This document will present as main adopted architectural style the 3-layered architecture, that we combine with other architectural choices. For the business logic layer, in fact, we will present a micro-services architecture, while for the presentation layer we will adopt a client-side rendering architecture, in which the client (the web browser and the mobile app) is responsible for rendering the GUI of the application. These architectural choices will be further explained in the following chapter of the DD.
